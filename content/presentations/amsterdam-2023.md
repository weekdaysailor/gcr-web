# Redefining Climate Economics with a Carbon Currency

**Event:** Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences Presentation
**Date:** November 24, 2023, 11:00 AM CET
**Location:** Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Centre for Economic Transformation, HvA Corry Tendeloohuis, Fraijlemaborg 133, 1102 CV Amsterdam

## Description

The presentation explored an innovative economic theory addressing systemic climate risk. As described, the session examined "why central banks are needed to support a new policy for climate mitigation" through a novel financial instrument called carbon currency.

## Key Topics Covered

The carbon currency framework targets four primary applications:

1. Exchanging fossil fuel reserves for clean energy assets
2. Decarbonizing carbon-intensive industries
3. Atmospheric carbon removal
4. Supporting community and ecosystem co-benefits

The presenter critiqued conventional economic models, arguing they inadequately address systemic market failures in carbon pricing.

## Participants

- **Presenter:** Dr. Delton Chen (Project Director & Founder, GCR)
- **Moderator:** Dr. Willem van Winden (Professor of Urban Economic Studies)
