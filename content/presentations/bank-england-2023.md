## Description

The presentation introduces a climate mitigation approach called Global Carbon Reward (GCR), described as "a mitigate-and-trade policy that employs a new type of carbon asset, referred to as a carbon currency (XCC)." The initiative aims to manage systemic risks from greenhouse gas emissions through financial mechanisms and central bank involvement.

## Key Policy Components

- New carbon asset framework (carbon currency/XCC)
- Financial mechanism and rulebook for supply/demand management
- Revised central bank mandates
- "Carbon quantitative easing" program
- Decarbonization incentives across energy, industry, and household sectors
- Co-benefits targeting for communities and ecosystems
