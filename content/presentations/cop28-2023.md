# COP28 UAE | Global Carbon Reward

**Event:** COP28 UAE
**Date:** November 30 - December 12, 2023
**Location:** Dubai, UAE

## Overview

The Global Carbon Reward (GCR) initiative presented at three separate COP28 side events. The organization positioned their policy as addressing a critical gap in the COP28 climate roadmap by providing a scalable financial mechanism for clean energy transitions and atmospheric carbon removal.

## Key Message

The page emphasizes that while COP28 called for transitioning away from fossil fuels, it lacked comprehensive financing solutions. The GCR framework proposes a novel reward system for mitigated carbon that incorporates central banking mandates while avoiding problematic offsetting practices.

## Presentations Offered

1. **UNCC Global Innovation Hub** - 10-minute presentation with slide deck (December 10, 2023)
2. **Bhutan Pavilion** - 10-minute interview format
3. **Bhutan Pavilion** - 1-hour discussion with Q&A session

## Core Objectives

The policy aims to support three interconnected outcomes: "healthy ecosystems, vibrant communities, and reliable clean energy."
