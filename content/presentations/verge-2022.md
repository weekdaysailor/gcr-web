# How A New Currency Could Help Solve the Climate Crisis

**Event:** VERGE 2022
**Date:** Wednesday, October 26, 2022
**Location:** San Jose McEnery Convention Center, California

## Overview

The presentation explored the concept of "carbon coin," a theoretical new currency backed by central banks that organizations could earn by reducing or eliminating emissions. This idea, featured prominently in Kim Stanley Robinson's novel "Ministry for the Future," is transitioning from fiction to potential reality.

## Key Speakers

- **Kim Stanley Robinson** - Science fiction author and creator of the "carbon coin" concept in his novel
- **Dr. Delton Chen** - Civil engineer and originator of the carbon currency framework; founder of Global Carbon Reward (GCR)
- **Molly Wood** - Moderator; multimedia journalist and investor covering climate and technology

## Main Discussion Points

The session addressed how "a new currency...earned by avoiding emissions or removing greenhouse gases" could incentivize climate action. Participants discussed GCR's plans for real-world trials of the carbon coin concept and its transformative potential for addressing climate change through financial innovation.
