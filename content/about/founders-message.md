# Founder's Message

> "The Global Carbon Reward is a citizen-led initiative to protect the climate, communities and ecosystems." — Dr. Delton Chen

## Welcome

Dr. Delton Chen founded the Global Carbon Reward Initiative based on using a carbon reward (XCR) to mobilize climate action globally. According to the page, this instrument serves multiple purposes: economic stimulus, ecosystem service payments, and long-term investment. Crucially, the reward market differs from existing carbon markets because it avoids carbon offsetting entirely.

## Our Mission

The organization aims to communicate a fresh narrative about resolving climate challenges through the Global Carbon Reward mechanism, actively seeking official partners and sponsors for demonstration projects.

## Important Update

In October 2025, the organization replaced the terminology "carbon currency" (XCC) with "carbon reward" (XCR) for improved scientific clarity.
