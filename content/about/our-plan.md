# Our Plan

Our goal is to advocate and advance the Global Carbon Reward policy with our international partners, by demonstrating the policy's capacity to incentivise a variety of climate mitigation methods and co-benefits, and the policy's adaptability in diverse geographic settings.

## Three Key Milestones

### Partnering

The initial phase focuses on establishing collaborations with recognized NGOs and creating GCR think tanks across multiple countries. These think tanks will facilitate public-private partnerships involving governments, low-carbon technology firms, and nonprofit organizations with sponsorship arrangements.

### Demonstrations

The second phase involves launching policy demonstrations with national governments over several years. A specialized currency trading team will manage the carbon currency's value and establish floor pricing. The demonstrations may utilize blockchain technology and involve various low-carbon projects including renewable energy, reforestation, carbon capture, and industrial decarbonization.

### Communication

The final milestone emphasizes outreach through documentaries, conferences, and social media to showcase how GCR can address climate mitigation at necessary scales, potentially creating an international movement.
