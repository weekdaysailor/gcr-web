# Our Mission

"Our mission is to demonstrate and advocate a regenerative financial system that can advance a low-carbon transition while promoting ecological health, community wellbeing, and energy reliability." (Updated January 18, 2025)

## Four Core Tasks

The organization commits to completing these objectives:

1. **Establish demonstrations**
2. **Manage operations**
3. **Advocate the policy**
4. **Propose a multilateral governance architecture**

## Detailed Focus Areas

### Demonstrations

The organization prioritizes developing Global Carbon Reward showcases featuring diverse low-carbon technologies through public-private partnerships. These initiatives illustrate how governments can fund climate action without direct taxation and demonstrate how international cost-sharing conflicts can be resolved through a global climate mitigation services market. The demonstrations emphasize stakeholder consensus based on outcome ranking and financial incentives for improved people and planet results.

### Operations

Operational priorities include securing private and public partnership support for policy demonstrations and documenting initiatives through films, social media, and conference presentations.

### Advocacy

The team explains how the GCR policy finances effective climate mitigation at macroeconomic scales while addressing local social and ecological concerns at microeconomic levels.

### Multilateralism

The organization proposes multilateral treaty architecture grounded in the preventative insurance principle, complementing the polluter pays principle.
