# Our Vision

> "Our vision is a world with a safe climate, together with healthy ecosystems, vibrant communities, and reliable clean energy."

## Three Strategic Pillars

### 1. Resolve

The organization aims to address the climate crisis through incentive-based mechanisms combining "carrot and stick" approaches for climate mitigation. This centers on a novel pricing theory for carbon and proposes carbon rewards to finance climate action and associated benefits.

### 2. Coordinate

The goal involves aligning governments, markets, and citizens toward collaborative climate management, ecosystem protection, and social advancement. This relies on establishing a global carbon reward marketplace and stakeholder engagement through reward weighting preferences.

### 3. Rebalance

The vision seeks to restructure the economy by creating negative feedback on carbon emissions via carbon rewards. This involves implementing a carbon currency system, expanding central bank mandates, and adopting a new social principle for equitable cost distribution.
