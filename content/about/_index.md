## About the Global Carbon Reward

The Global Carbon Reward is a comprehensive climate policy framework designed to mobilize unprecedented levels of finance for climate mitigation while supporting healthy ecosystems, vibrant communities, and reliable clean energy.

### Our Approach

The Global Carbon Reward Initiative is a citizen-led effort to protect the climate, communities, and ecosystems through a novel financial mechanism called the carbon reward (XCR). This instrument serves multiple purposes: economic stimulus, ecosystem service payments, and long-term investment. Crucially, the reward market differs from existing carbon markets because it avoids carbon offsetting entirely.
