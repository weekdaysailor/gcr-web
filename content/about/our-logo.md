    <h3>1. The Letter "C"</h3>
    <p>Represents elemental carbon and symbolizes greenhouse gas mitigation rather than pollution. The blue color signifies "the Earth's atmosphere during the day."</p>

  <div class="summary-card">
    <img src="/images/logo-icon-02.png" alt="The Reboot Symbol" style="width: 100px; margin: 0 auto 1rem; display: block;">
    <h3>2. The Reboot Symbol</h3>
    <p>The "C" combines with a line to form the iconic reboot symbol found on computer power switches. This represents the policy's goal to "reboot the world economy for stabilising the climate and protecting the planetary ecosystem."</p>

  <div class="summary-card">
    <img src="/images/logo-icon-03.png" alt="Thermometer Design" style="width: 100px; margin: 0 auto 1rem; display: block;">
    <h3>3. Thermometer Design</h3>
    <p>The reboot symbol's line features a distinctive bulge representing the policy's target of remaining "below 1.5 to 2.0°C of global warming as proposed in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement." The curved line resembles a thermometer reflecting Earth's surface temperature concerns.</p>

    <h3>4. Seventeen Leaves</h3>
    <p>The logo includes 17 leaves representing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The leaves feature a "red-green-blue colour wheel over a 360 degree rotation" symbolizing "the flow of time, the diversity of species...and the diversity of human cultures."</p>
