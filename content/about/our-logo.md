The Global Carbon Reward logo contains four major symbolic elements designed to represent the organization's climate and economic mission.

## Four Key Elements

### 1. The Letter "C"

Represents elemental carbon and symbolizes greenhouse gas mitigation rather than pollution. The blue color signifies "the Earth's atmosphere during the day."

### 2. The Reboot Symbol

The "C" combines with a line to form the iconic reboot symbol found on computer power switches. This represents the policy's goal to "reboot the world economy for stabilising the climate and protecting the planetary ecosystem."

### 3. Thermometer Design

The reboot symbol's line features a distinctive bulge representing the policy's target of remaining "below 1.5 to 2.0°C of global warming as proposed in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement." The curved line resembles a thermometer reflecting Earth's surface temperature concerns.

### 4. Seventeen Leaves

The logo includes 17 leaves representing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The leaves feature a "red-green-blue colour wheel over a 360 degree rotation" symbolizing "the flow of time, the diversity of species...and the diversity of human cultures."
