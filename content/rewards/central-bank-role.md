# Central Bank Role

The working paper defines a **central bank monetary-carbon alliance** as the market-maker that would defend the XCR price floor with Carbon Quantitative Easing (CQE). This alliance is proposed—not yet established—and would operate alongside the Carbon Exchange Authority (CEA) to keep the carbon reward credible and investable.

## Why Central Banks Are Needed

- **Price floor defense:** When XCR spot prices threaten to fall below the defended floor, the alliance would purchase XCR with new bank reserves (M0), expanding narrow money (M1) and supporting market confidence.
- **Systemic stability:** By coordinating interventions, the alliance mitigates disorderly repricing, supports FX stability, and distributes mitigation costs across global financial markets.
- **Mandate alignment:** Members would add climate/systemic-risk objectives to existing price-stability and financial-stability mandates, subject to enabling legislation.
- **Market-and-system failure:** The paper reframes unpriced GHGs as a systemic risk to the carbon cycle (Definition Boxes 3–5). That risk can amplify the negative externality and destabilize economies, so monetary mandates must explicitly cover it.
- **Preventive insurance logic:** Carbon rewards are the “carrot” paired with polluter-pays “sticks.” Central bank support prices the systemic externality to keep the economy within a safe carbon budget, similar to insuring against tail risks.
- **Financial stability rationale:** Disorderly transition and stranded assets create spillovers into banking and FX markets. CQE provides a backstop only at the floor, reducing whiplash and contagion.

## How CQE Would Work

- **Trigger:** CQE activates only when market prices test the XCR floor.
- **Mechanism:** Central banks buy XCR in proportion to a common formula to minimize FX disruption and balance inflation impacts.
- **Funding:** Purchases use base money creation; CQE does *not* issue XCR—that role sits with the CEA via reward contracts.
- **Equity:** Allocation formulas and directed reward flows are designed to support developing economies while maintaining currency stability.

## Governance & Coordination

- **CEA interface:** The CEA sets and revises the Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC) pathway and price floor guidance; the alliance executes monetary support when needed.
- **Legal authority:** Most central banks would require explicit mandates to conduct CQE and to treat the XCR price floor as a public-good stability objective.
- **Transparency:** Published RCC paths and CQE playbooks provide forward guidance to markets and policymakers.

## Status and Next Steps

This alliance is a **proposed** component of the carbon reward policy. Implementation depends on:

1. Enabling mandates and legislation for participating central banks.
2. Treaty or climate-club agreements defining RCC governance and CQE formulas.
3. Demonstration projects to validate MRV, contract design, and FX market operations.
