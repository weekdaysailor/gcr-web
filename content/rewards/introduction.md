# Introduction

The carbon reward (XCR) is a new type of financial instrument that will be offered for mitigated carbon with aims to help manage anthropogenic carbon balance and avoid dangerous climate change.

## Core Characteristics

### Digital Asset Structure

- Denoted as "XCR" and traded in foreign exchange markets
- Backed by central banks and sovereign guarantees
- Issued debt-free with long-term price floor support
- Bankable but not a carbon credit or legal tender

### Important Distinction

**The XCR will be tradable, it is not a carbon credit and it cannot be used to offset carbon emissions.**

## Three Reward Channels

1. **Carbon dioxide removal from atmosphere**
2. **Conventional greenhouse gas mitigation**
3. **Co-benefits and harm reduction for communities and ecosystems**

## Four Main Principles

### Carbon Mitigating, Not Offsetting

Rewards address emissions at source and atmospheric removal, rejecting offset mechanisms.

### Carbon Assets, Not Offsets

XCR functions as financial asset with price floor, not as offset instrument.

### Reward Multiplier

Customizable payment structure (R) designed for cost-effective outcomes across industries.

### Causal Mechanisms

Effectiveness grounded in performance-based grants, decentralized assessment, foreign exchange integration, and long-term contract tracking.

## Mitigation Technologies

Examples span three categories:

### Cleaner Energy
- Renewable substitution
- Battery storage
- Green methane
- CCS integration

### Cleaner Business
- Building/industry carbon reduction
- Carbon farming
- Transportation electrification
- Food waste reduction

### Carbon Removal
- Reforestation
- Direct air capture
- Avoided deforestation
- Blue carbon sequestration
