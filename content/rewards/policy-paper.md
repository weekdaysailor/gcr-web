about_paper_body: |
  This working paper presents, for the first time, the carbon reward policy with technical clarity and economic
  justifications. The approach has already inspired major discussion in climate economics and was popularised as
  the “carbon coin” in Kim Stanley Robinson’s *The Ministry for the Future*. The paper details how this mechanism
  can help achieve Paris Agreement targets, encourage systemic safety, and break through political gridlock.

research_summary: |
  Dr. Chen’s research introduces the world’s first integrated framework for pricing carbon with both penalties and
  rewards, offering a solution for the climate finance gap and systemic risks that threaten global stability. The policy
  mobilises central banks to support verified climate mitigation via a sovereign-backed financial asset—the Carbon
  Reward (XCR)—unlike offsets or credits. The XCR mechanism aims to unlock trillions in private investment without
  imposing direct costs on governments, businesses, or taxpayers, fostering cooperative, debt-free decarbonisation.
