## Carbon Rewards

The carbon reward (XCR) is a new type of financial instrument designed to mobilize climate action globally. This innovative mechanism serves multiple purposes: economic stimulus, ecosystem service payments, and long-term investment—all while avoiding carbon offsetting entirely.

### Key Features

The XCR represents a fundamental shift in how we finance climate mitigation:

- **Digital Asset Structure** - Traded in foreign exchange markets and backed by central banks
- **Debt-Free Issuance** - Created without government debt obligations
- **Performance-Based** - Rewards actual emissions reductions and carbon removal
- **Co-Benefits Focus** - Incentivizes community wellbeing and ecosystem health

### Important Distinction

The carbon reward differs from traditional carbon markets: it is tradable but **not a carbon credit** and **cannot be used to offset emissions**. Instead, it rewards mitigation at the source and atmospheric carbon removal.
