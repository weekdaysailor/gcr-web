# Carbon Exchange Authority

The Carbon Exchange Authority (CEA) is the proposed technocratic backbone of the carbon reward system. It would issue XCR grants, manage long-duration reward contracts, and steer the reward channels so the policy remains credible, investable, and fair over time. The defended XCR price floor itself would be maintained by a central bank monetary-carbon alliance via CQE.

## Core Functions

- **Price Path Governance** — Publishes rolling Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC) pathways and guidance for the defended XCR price floor to keep expectations anchored.
- **Monetary Coordination** — Works with the central bank monetary-carbon alliance that would deploy Carbon Quantitative Easing (CQE) when spot prices test the floor.
- **Contract Stewardship** — Issues, monitors, and enforces 100-year reward contracts with milestones, clawbacks, and transparent registry data.
- **Assurance & Verification** — Oversees measurement, reporting, and verification across the three reward channels: removals, conventional mitigation, and community dividends.
- **Risk Management** — Identifies systemic risks to the carbon cycle, runs stress scenarios, and coordinates with central banks on liquidity and backstop mechanisms.

## Why It Matters

- **Credibility for investors** — A defended floor and predictable RCC path make decarbonization investable at scale.
- **Policy durability** — Transparent rules and clawbacks maintain integrity and public trust.
- **Systemic stability** — Clear governance plus CQE coordination reduce the chance of policy whiplash or market freezes.

## How It Fits in the Policy

- **Works with central banks** that would defend the XCR floor via CQE when needed.
- **Partners with regulators and standards bodies** to harmonize verification and reporting.
- **Coordinates with project developers and communities** so reward channels deliver measurable mitigation and co-benefits.
