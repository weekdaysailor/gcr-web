  <p>The carbon reward (XCR) is a proposed sovereign-supported financial instrument issued for verified climate mitigation and removal. It aims to mobilize private capital by pairing long-duration contracts with a defended price floor overseen by a future central bank alliance.</p>
  <p class="callout"><strong>Not an offset:</strong> XCR is tradable but not a carbon credit and cannot be used to offset emissions. It rewards real-world mitigation at the source and atmospheric removals.</p>
  <ul class="identity-points">
    <li><strong>Bankable asset:</strong> Denominated as “XCR”, designed for FX markets, with proposed central bank alliance support.</li>
    <li><strong>Debt-free issuance:</strong> Created without adding fiscal burden; price support defends long-term credibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance-based:</strong> Contracts include milestones, verification, and clawbacks to keep incentives tight.</li>
  </ul>
