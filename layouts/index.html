                The Global Carbon Reward proposes a sovereign-backed reward system designed to mobilize
                private capital, accelerate deep decarbonisation, and manage systemic risks to the carbon cycle—
                all without increasing fiscal burdens.

            <h2>The Problem: A Market-and-System Failure</h2>
            <p>
                Climate change is not just a classic negative externality—it is a systemic externality driven by
                self-reinforcing feedbacks. The result is a cycle where rising systemic carbon costs trigger
                stalled mitigation, political pushback, and delayed investment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Address systemic risks that conventional carbon pricing leaves unresolved.</li>
                <li>Break the political deadlock with reward-based incentives.</li>
                <li>Mobilize global private capital at scale for verifiable mitigation.</li>
                <li>Deliver predictable, long-term pricing signals for investors and communities.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What This Means</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional tools require two derisking pathways to deliver mitigation at global scale.
                We need instruments that manage systemic externalities and accelerate coordinated action.

                Without positive incentives and an anchored price floor, the cycle repeats,
                locking in risk and delaying investment. The Global Carbon Reward interrupts the loop
                by combining sovereign guarantees with targeted reward channels.

            <h2>An Incentive-Based Framework for Systemic Safety</h2>
            <p>
                The Global Carbon Reward provides positive financial incentives for verifiable mitigation,
                funded by a central-bank alliance that defends a rolling XCR price floor. The framework
                makes climate mitigation investable by pairing conditional grants with long-duration contracts.

                <li>Reward Channels cover carbon removal, conventional mitigation, and community dividends.</li>
                <li>The Carbon Exchange Authority manages RCC price paths, milestones, and clawbacks.</li>
                <li>A Carbon Quantitative Easing (CQE) capacity supports the XCR floor when markets wobble.</li>

            <h3>Key Innovation: The Dual-Externality Framework</h3>
            <p>
                GCR distinguishes two intertwined problems that require paired policy signals:

            <div class="dual-list">
                <div>
                    <strong>Rising SCC</strong>
                    <p>Addressed with carbon taxes or caps that deliver social efficiency.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <strong>Systemic risk to the carbon cycle</strong>
                    <p>Addressed with XCR rewards that stabilize expectations and crowd in capital.</p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Together, these tools align public mandates with private incentives, delivering climate stability
                without increasing fiscal burdens.
